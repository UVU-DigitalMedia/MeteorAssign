# MeteorAssign
An assignment to gain exposure to Meteor.

Meteor is a framework from writing real-time web apps. It is a full MVC framework that syncs data between a server and the client seamlessly.

>Meteor gives you a radically simpler way to build realtime mobile and web apps, entirely in JavaScript from one code base.

Here is the [Meteor Homepage}(https://www.meteor.com/)


#Steps
We will be stating from scratch on this assignment and pushing your finished code to you github account, and turning in a URL to the repo.

# Assignment

Your assignment is to work through the [Meteor tutorials.](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app)

You will be woring through both the Todo App Turorial and the Todo app with React Tutorial. (*NOT* the Angular Todo App. This used angular 1 and isn't worth the time. :grimacing:)

You will need to turn in 14 commits on 2 branches (7 commits on each). One for each of the fallowing chapters:

**TODO APP TUTORIAL**

- 2. Templates
- 3. Collections
- 4. Forms and Events
- 5. Update and Remove
- 8. Filtering Collections
- 9. Adding User Accounts
- 10. Security with Methods

**TODO APP WITH REACT TUTORIAL**

- 2. Templates
- 3. Collections
- 4. Forms and Events
- 5. Update and Remove
- 8. Filtering Collections
- 9. Adding User Accounts
- 10. Security with Methods

Finish chapter '1. Creating an App' for the Todo app. Do a `git init` and commit to the master branch. Here is where both of your branches will start. At this point, create 2 branches, one for the Todo App and one for the Todo App with React.


Include a README file that includes the following (Add emojis. It makes things more fun! :smile: ):

- Name of project
- Build instructions
- What you learned
- What you found difficult
- What are the advantages to branching in Git?
- Researh two types of git workflows, and describe their process. (Gitflow, Github Workflow, Forking Workflow, Centrlized Workflow. ETC.)
  - What are the advantages and disadvantages of each workflow.

Also, as part of this assignment, you will need to include a .gitignore file to ignore files that *shouldn't* be tracked by git.



#Tips
- You will need to install the Meteor CLI. [Here](https://www.meteor.com/install) is how to do it.
