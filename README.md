# MeteorAssign
An assignment to gain exposure to Meteor.

Meteor is a framework from writing real-time web apps. It is a full MVC framework that syncs data between a server and the client seamlessly.

>Meteor gives you a radically simpler way to build realtime mobile and web apps, entirely in JavaScript from one code base.

Here is the [Meteor Homepage}(https://www.meteor.com/)


#Steps
We will be stating from scratch on this assignment and pushing your finished code to you github account, and turning in a URL to the repo.

# Assignment

Your assignment is to work through the [Meteor tutorials.](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app)

You will be woring through both the Todo App Turorial and the Todo app with React Tutorial.

You will need to turn in 14 commits. One for each of the fallowing chapters:

- 2. Templates
- 3. Collections
- 4. Forms and Events
- 5. Update and Remove
- 8. Filtering Collections
- 9. Adding User Accounts
- 10. Security with Methods



Include a README file that includes the following (Add emojis. It makes things more fun! :smile: ):

- Name of project
- Build instructions
- What you learned
- What you found difficult
- Why are .gitignore files important

Also, as part of this assignment, you will need to include a .gitignore file to ignore files that *shouldn't* be tracked by git.



#Tips
- Typescript is a strongly typed language. Learn more about type systems [here.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/introduction-to-programming-type-systems/)
- Angular 2 is a complete rewrite from Angular 1. It is still in open beta, but it is poised to be a big deal in web development.
- Don't worry if you don't understand all the specifics with the details of the framework. Try and keep a broad view of how things connect. At the end of the day, in Angular we are still writing web components. Like what we did in Polymer or React.
- Research .gitignore files and why you should use them.
